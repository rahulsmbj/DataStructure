Solve following problems.
1. Implement binary search if array is sorted in descending order.
2. Implement Fibonacci search. Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fibonacci-search/
3. Write a function to return number of comparisons for a bubble sort. Write another function to return number of swapping for bubble sort. Compare result for the same input array.
4. Decimal to binary conversion recursive code prints binary equivalent in reverse order (as discussed in class). Modify it produce correct output.
