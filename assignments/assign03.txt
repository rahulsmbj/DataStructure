Solve following problems.
1. Input an infix expression from user and solve it. Expression have multi-digit operands and operators separated by spaces.
2. Simulate FCFS scheduling algorithm. Consider following input and calculate turn-around time for each process. Turn-around time is completion time - arrival time.
	Process		Arrival		Time
		P1			0		23
		P2			6		4
		P3			8		5
		P4			9		12
